After reviewing the overview and todo list, I think the plan is well-structured and comprehensive. A few observations before we start:

1. **Tech Stack Choice**: Using Vite instead of Create React App is a good decision as it offers faster development experience and better performance.

2. **Project Structure**: The architecture outlined in overview.md follows best practices with clear separation of concerns and a modular approach that will scale well.

3. **Implementation Phases**: Breaking the project into three phases makes sense - starting with core infrastructure, then enhancing resources, and finally adding polish and advanced features.

4. **Potential Considerations**:
   - Firebase costs might increase with heavy usage, so we should implement efficient data fetching patterns
   - We might want to consider implementing error boundaries early on
   - For AI integration, we should plan for rate limiting and fallbacks

5. **Testing Strategy**: While testing is mentioned in Phase 3, we might want to incorporate some basic testing earlier, especially for critical paths like authentication.

Overall, this is a solid plan. The modular architecture will allow us to build incrementally while maintaining a clean codebase. I'm ready to start implementing when you are!
